# Volunteer Coordination and Management System Frontend

This project is the **Volunteer Coordination and Management System** frontend, built to interact with the backend services developed using **NestJS**. The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for **Admins**, **Event Managers**, **Volunteers**, and **Sponsors** to manage and interact with their respective features. The frontend communicates with the backend via **REST APIs** using **Axios** for HTTP requests, and **Toaster** for real-time notifications.

## Features

- User Authentication (JWT-based)
- Session Management
- Responsive Design for Desktop and Mobile
- Toaster Notifications for Success/Failure
- Error Handling and Input Validations

### Admin
- Manage Event Managers, Volunteers, and Sponsors
- Perform CRUD Operations on Users
- Generate and View Reports

### Event Manager
- Create, Update, and Delete Events
- Assign and Manage Volunteers

- Receive Notifications

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend Framework:** ReactJS (or any other framework you used)
- **State Management:** React Context API (or other if used)
- **HTTP Client:** Axios
- **Notifications:** React Toaster
- **Authentication:** JWT (from backend)
- **Forms and Validation:** React Hook Form and Yup

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

## API Integration

This frontend uses **Axios** to communicate with the backend APIs. API requests are centralized in the `services/` folder, making it easy to maintain and reuse. Below are the key API integrations:

- **Auth:** 
  - Login: `POST /auth/login`
  - Register: `POST /auth/register`
  
- **Volunteer:**
  - Register: `POST /volunteer/register`
  - Update Profile: `PUT /volunteer/update-profile`
  
- **Event Manager:**
  - Create Event: `POST /event/create`
  - Update Event: `PUT /event/update`
  - Delete Event: `DELETE /event/delete`

- **Admin:**
  - Manage Users: `GET /admin/manage-users`
  - Generate Reports: `GET /admin/generate-reports`

## State Management

- **React Context API** is used for global state management. It handles user authentication status, session management, and other shared states across different pages.
- **Axios Interceptors** are implemented to handle token injection for secured API calls.

## Toaster Notifications

The project uses **React Toaster** to show real-time feedback for user actions such as:
- Successful login, registration, or updates
- Errors such as authentication failures or validation errors
- Custom notifications for event-related activities

## Validation

**React Hook Form** along with **Yup** is used for form handling and validation to ensure correct data is submitted to the backend. Example validations include:
- Email format validation
- Password strength checks
- Required fields for profile updates
